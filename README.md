# _BeamNG.ui_

This project is working on the User Interface of the vehicle simulator [BeamNG](http://www.beamng.com).

## Project Setup

As BeamNG uses the [Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)](https://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/), it is very simple to develop, test and integrate the UI: simply develop in Chrome or Firefox :)

## Demo

The links below point to the latest development version, so it might be broken:
* [Main Menu](http://rawgithub.com/BeamNG/ui/master/mainmenu.html)
* [Options Menu](http://rawgithub.com/BeamNG/ui/master/options.html)

## Contributing

We suggest that you contact us upfront in case you want to help us, so maybe we can help you along a bit :)

## Testing

There are no (automated) tests yet, but they will be done at some point.

## Deploying

If you entered the BeamNG Alpha and are using at least version 0.3.1 (which is not released to general public as of 24/11/2014), you can replace the content of the /html/ folder with this repository's content.

If you want to contribute to this project and have not entered the Alpha Testing yet, we will happily provide you with keys :)
